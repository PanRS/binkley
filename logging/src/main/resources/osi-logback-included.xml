    <!--
    Any custom logger configuration goes here rather than osi-logback.xml.

    Create a custom osi-logback-included.xml and either make it a file in the current
    directory, or place it at the root of the classpath ahead of binkley-logging.jar.

    For custom appenders also set "logback.rootAppender" to change from console logging.
